This is a seeded block matching algorithm written in Matlab.
It should work with version 7.9.0 or higher.  The inputs to this
code are two images along with a parameter structure containing
the block matching parameters.  

The algorithm is an implementation of the block matching code
described by Chen et al.  The paper is included in the 
repository as a pdf.
